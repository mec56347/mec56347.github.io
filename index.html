<P> The Atlanta Falcons are members of the National Football Conference<abbr title="National Football Conference"> (NFC)</abbr>
    South Division.They joined the NFL on June 30, 1965 as an expansion team, and are considered one of the oldest
    NFL franchises in <I> The Deep South </I> along with <B> The Miami Dolphins</B>. The Falcons
    have a total record of 316-414-6, and have only ever been to one Super Bowl, in 1998,
    but has yet to actually win one. </P>
  </div>
    <div style="text-align:left">
<P> The Falcons play their home games at the Georgia Dome, in downtown Atlanta Georgia,
    but currently there is a new stadium being built called the Mercedes-Benz Stadium which
    the Falcons are set to start playing at, in the beginning of the 2017-2018 season. While
    the Falcons play their home games at the Georgia Dome, their headquarters for their Franchise
    is based out of Flowery Branch, Georgia, on the outskirts of rural Atlanta.</P>

    The Falcons, in the current season, are 6-3 and are widely regarded as having the most highpowered
    offense in the league. Team leaders, Matt Ryan, Julio Jones, Devonta Freeman, and Vic Beasley, just
    to name a few, are the face of the current franchise and are main reasons why the current team
    is having as much success as it is. Julio and Matt Ryan have both been considered as MVP
    candidates and will, hopefully, lead this team to the franchise's first ever Super Bowl Win!</P>
